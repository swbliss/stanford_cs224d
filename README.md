# stanford_cs224d
This project contains codes for assignments of Stanford CS224D class, implemented with Python2.7 and Tensorflow library.


## assignement1
link: http://cs224d.stanford.edu/assignment1/assignment1.pdf

In this assignment we will familiarize you with basic concepts of neural networks, word vectors, and their application to sentiment analysis.



## assignement2
link: http://cs224d.stanford.edu/assignment2/index.html

In this assignment you will learn how to use TensorFlow to solve problems in NLP. In particular, you'll use TensorFlow to implement feed-forward neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and apply them to the tasks of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Language Modeling (LM).
